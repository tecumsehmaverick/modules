Frontend modules is a bunch of css, js and html that together turn in something useful in a web page.

This project works with automated tasks will run preprocessors for all frontend layers (styles, scripts and templates). Although the template layer most of the time will be processed by server-side processing, like in this projetc, which is using SymphonyCMS and XSL for templating.
